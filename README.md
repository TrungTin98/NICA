Authors: Trung-Tin Luu, Thanh-Binh Nguyen, Minh-Man Ngo

Pre-print: [Missing Data Imputation using Neural Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00651)

This directory contains implementations of NICA framework for imputation on multiple datasets from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

Example command to run the pipeline for training and imputing: `python main_imputation.py`
